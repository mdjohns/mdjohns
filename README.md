- 🎓️ **Graduating this December** from [UALR](https://ualr.edu/) with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
- 🍃️ Currently based in **Little Rock, AR**, but I'm looking to find the right job **wherever it may be**.
- ⚡ I'm most excited about JavaScript: In particular, I've been tinkering with React, Express, and Svelte.
